## **📊 Overview**

This application implements a Markov Chain model to predict weather patterns across five US regions:
- **Southwest** (AZ, NM, NV, UT, CO)
- **Pacific Northwest** (WA, OR)
- **Northeast** (NY, MA, CT, NJ, PA)
- **Southeast** (FL, GA, AL, SC, NC)
- **Midwest** (IL, IN, OH, MI, WI)

The model simulates transitions between three weather states: ☀️ **Sunny**, 🌧️ **Rainy**, and ☁️ **Cloudy**.

## **✨ Features**

### **Core Functionality**
- **Markov Chain Simulation**: Simulates weather transitions using probability matrices
- **Regional Analysis**: Custom transition probabilities for each US region
- **Probability Forecasting**: Predicts rain probability for 1, 3, 7, 14, and 30 days ahead
- **Statistical Validation**: Compares theoretical vs empirical distributions
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Heatmaps, probability charts, and comparison plots

### **User Interface**
- **Centered Layout**: Clean, minimalist design with black-and-white theme
- **Inter Font**: Modern typography throughout the application
- **Interactive Controls**: Adjust simulation parameters in real-time
- **Weather Badges**: Visual representation of simulated weather sequences
- **Tab-based Navigation**: Organized into three main sections

## Model Details
Markov Chain Implementation

- States: Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy
- Transition Matrices: Region-specific probabilities based on historical patterns
- Stationary Distribution: Calculated using power iteration method 
- N-step Transition: Computed using matrix exponentiation

Statistical Analysis
- KL Divergence: Measures difference between theoretical and empirical distributions
- Chi-Square Test: Validates model fit against observed data
- Mean Absolute Error: Average prediction error
- Probability Calculations: Rain probability for future days

Regional Data
Each region has:
- Custom transition probability matrix
- Initial probability distribution
- State abbreviations for reference
- Based on simplified historical weather patterns

## Technical Details
### Algorithm Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n × m × s²) where n = days, m = simulations, s = states
- Space Complexity: O(m × n) for storing simulation results
- Convergence: Stationary distribution calculated with tolerance 1e-10

### Limitations
- Simplified 3-state weather model
- Stationary climate assumptions
- Regional averages may not reflect local variations
- No seasonal variation in transition probabilities
